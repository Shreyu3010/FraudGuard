## Workflow Overview

### Step 1: Data Ingestion

Loaded data in manageable chunks for efficiency. Kept all fraud samples while using a small portion of non-fraud records to balance memory and data distribution.

### Step 2: Data Validation

Checked for missing values, invalid types, and inconsistencies. Optimized data types for faster computation and lower memory usage.

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized key patterns in transaction type, amount, and fraud ratio. Discovered how certain transaction types have higher fraud tendencies.

### Step 4: Feature Creation

Derived new attributes such as balance difference and transaction ratios. Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder and normalized numeric data for better model performance.

### Step 5: Balancing the Data

Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle skewed class distribution. Ensured the model gets equal exposure to both fraud and non-fraud samples.

### Step 6: Model Building

Trained a LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model for predictive accuracy and speed. Tuned hyperparameters for optimized performance on imbalanced data.

### Step 7: Model Evaluation

Assessed model performance using multiple metrics:
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve Visuals

Focused on high recall to reduce missed frauds while maintaining good precision.

### Step 8: Model Preservation

Saved the trained model using pickle for easy reuse in production or further analysis.
