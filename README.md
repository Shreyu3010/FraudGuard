💳 Fraud Detection Model
🧠 Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning.
The goal is to build a reliable and efficient model that identifies fraud cases while keeping false alarms low.

The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, balancing classes using SMOTE, model training with LightGBM, and performance evaluation using various metrics.

🚀 Steps Performed
1. Data Loading

The dataset is read in chunks to handle memory efficiently.

All fraud transactions are kept, and a small sample of non-fraud ones are taken to balance memory use.

2. Data Validation

Verified missing values, column consistency, and correct data types.

Converted categorical and numeric columns to suitable formats.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized transaction types, amounts, and fraud ratios.

Identified patterns between transaction type and likelihood of fraud.

4. Feature Engineering

Created new features like transaction difference and ratio-based features.

Encoded categorical data using LabelEncoder.

Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.

5. Handling Class Imbalance

Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance fraud vs. non-fraud cases.

6. Model Training

Implemented LightGBM, a gradient boosting algorithm optimized for large datasets.

Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy and reduced overfitting.

7. Evaluation

Evaluated using metrics like:

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC-AUC Score

Plotted Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve.

8. Model Saving

The final trained model was saved as fraud_model.pkl for future use.

📊 Results Summary
Metric	Value (Example)
Accuracy	~98%
Precision	~94%
Recall	~89%
F1 Score	~91%
ROC-AUC	~0.96

(These are sample values; actual results depend on the dataset and tuning.)
