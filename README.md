⚙️ Workflow Overview
🔹 Step 1: Data Ingestion

Loaded data in manageable chunks for efficiency.

Kept all fraud samples while using a small portion of non-fraud records to balance memory and data distribution.

🔹 Step 2: Data Validation

Checked for missing values, invalid types, and inconsistencies.

Optimized data types for faster computation and lower memory usage.

🔹 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized key patterns in transaction type, amount, and fraud ratio.

Discovered how certain transaction types have higher fraud tendencies.

🔹 Step 4: Feature Creation

Derived new attributes such as balance difference and transaction ratios.

Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder and normalized numeric data for better model performance.

🔹 Step 5: Balancing the Data

Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to handle skewed class distribution.

Ensured the model gets equal exposure to both fraud and non-fraud samples.

🔹 Step 6: Model Building

Trained a LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) model for predictive accuracy and speed.

Tuned hyperparameters for optimized performance on imbalanced data.

🔹 Step 7: Model Evaluation

Assessed model performance using multiple metrics:

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC

Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve Visuals

Focused on high recall to reduce missed frauds while maintaining good precision.

🔹 Step 8: Model Preservation

Saved the trained model using pickle for easy reuse in production or further analysis.
