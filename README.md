## 🚀 How to Use This Project (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data File

You need a CSV file named **`fraud.csv`** with your transaction data. The file should have these columns:

| Column Name | What It Means | Example |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `step` | Time period (1 step = 1 hour) | 1, 2, 3... |
| `type` | Type of transaction | PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT |
| `amount` | Transaction amount in dollars | 9839.64 |
| `nameOrig` | Customer who sent money | C1231006815 |
| `oldbalanceOrg` | Sender's balance before | 170136.00 |
| `newbalanceOrig` | Sender's balance after | 160296.36 |
| `nameDest` | Who received the money | M1979787155 |
| `oldbalanceDest` | Receiver's balance before | 0.00 |
| `newbalanceDest` | Receiver's balance after | 0.00 |
| `isFraud` | Is this fraud? (1=Yes, 0=No) | 0 |
| `isFlaggedFraud` | System flag (optional) | 0 |

**Example row:**
\`\`\`
1,PAYMENT,9839.64,C1231006815,170136,160296.36,M1979787155,0,0,0,0
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Run the Fraud Detection Script

Simply click the **"Run Script"** button on `fraud_detection_complete.py` or run this command:

\`\`\`bash
python scripts/fraud_detection_complete.py

**What happens when you run it:**

1. ✅ **Loads your data** - Reads fraud.csv in memory-efficient chunks
2. ✅ **Cleans the data** - Removes duplicates and handles missing values
3. ✅ **Creates smart features** - Builds fraud indicators from your data
4. ✅ **Trains AI model** - Learns fraud patterns using LightGBM algorithm
5. ✅ **Tests accuracy** - Evaluates how well it detects fraud
6. ✅ **Generates insights** - Provides business recommendations
7. ✅ **Saves the model** - Creates `fraud_model.pkl` for future use
8. ✅ **Creates visualizations** - Generates charts showing performance

### Step 3: Review the Results

## 🔍 Understanding the Results

### What Do These Metrics Mean?

| Metric | What It Means | Good Score |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **ROC-AUC** | Overall ability to distinguish fraud from legitimate | > 0.90 |
| **Precision** | When model says "fraud", how often is it right? | > 85% |
| **Recall** | Out of all real fraud, how many did we catch? | > 90% |
| **F1-Score** | Balance between precision and recall | > 0.85 |

### 🎯 Key Insights You'll Discover

The system will tell you:

1. **Which transaction types are risky**
   - Example: "Fraud ONLY happens in TRANSFER and CASH_OUT"
   - Action: Focus monitoring on these types

2. **What patterns indicate fraud**
   - Example: "Transactions with balance errors are 95% likely fraud"
   - Action: Add real-time balance validation

3. **Customer behavior red flags**
   - Example: "Accounts drained to $0 are suspicious"
   - Action: Alert when balance hits zero

4. **Expected business impact**
   - Example: "Can prevent $2.5M in fraud losses annually"
   - Action: Calculate ROI for implementing the system

## 💼 Real-World Application

### How to Use This in Your Business

#### Option 1: Real-Time Fraud Detection
\`\`\`python
# Load the trained model
import pickle
model = pickle.load(open('fraud_model.pkl', 'rb'))

# Score a new transaction
new_transaction = [...your transaction data...]
fraud_probability = model.predict_proba(new_transaction)[0][1]

if fraud_probability > 0.7:
    print("⚠️ HIGH RISK - Review this transaction!")
elif fraud_probability > 0.5:
    print("⚡ MEDIUM RISK - Flag for monitoring")
else:
    print("✅ LOW RISK - Approve")
\`\`\`

#### Option 2: Batch Processing
Process thousands of transactions at once:
- Upload daily transactions as CSV
- Run the model to score all transactions
- Export high-risk cases for investigation

#### Option 3: Integration with Existing Systems
- Connect to your payment gateway API
- Score transactions before approval
- Automatically block high-risk transactions

## 🛠️ Technical Details (For Data Scientists)

### Algorithm: LightGBM (Gradient Boosting)

**Why we chose this:**
- ⚡ Fast training on millions of rows
- 💾 Memory-efficient (works on large datasets)
- 🎯 Excellent for imbalanced data (fraud is rare)
- 📊 Provides feature importance rankings
- 🚀 Production-ready and scalable

### Handling Imbalanced Data

**The Challenge:** Fraud is rare (typically <1% of transactions)

**Our Solution:**
- Keep ALL fraud cases (100% of fraud data)
- Sample only 5% of non-fraud cases
- Use SMOTE to create synthetic fraud examples
- This gives the model enough fraud patterns to learn from

### Feature Engineering

We create smart indicators from your raw data:

\`\`\`python
# Balance consistency check
balance_error_orig = (oldbalanceOrg - newbalanceOrig) - amount

# Zero balance flags (suspicious pattern)
orig_zero_after = (newbalanceOrig == 0)

# Customer-to-customer transfers (high risk)
is_c2c_transfer = (nameOrig starts with 'C') AND (nameDest starts with 'C')
\`\`\`

### Memory Optimization

For large datasets (millions of rows):
- Reads data in 50,000 row chunks
- Processes each chunk separately
- Never loads entire dataset into memory
- Uses efficient data types (int32 instead of int64)

---

## 📊 Sample Output Visualizations

### 1. ROC Curve
Shows how well the model separates fraud from legitimate transactions. The closer to the top-left corner, the better.

### 2. Precision-Recall Curve
Shows the trade-off between catching fraud (recall) and avoiding false alarms (precision).

### 3. Confusion Matrix
\`\`\`
                Predicted
              Not Fraud  |  Fraud
Actual  -------------------------
Not Fraud |   95,000   |   500
Fraud     |      150   | 1,850
\`\`\`

### 4. Feature Importance
Ranks which factors matter most:
1. Balance error (40% importance)
2. Transaction type (25% importance)
3. Amount (15% importance)
4. Zero balance flags (12% importance)
5. Customer type (8% importance)

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Out of Memory" Error

**Solution:** The script automatically handles this by:
- Reading data in small chunks (50k rows at a time)
- Sampling non-fraud cases to reduce dataset size
- Using memory-efficient data types

If still failing, reduce `CHUNK_SIZE` in the script from 50000 to 25000.

### Problem: "File not found: fraud.csv"

**Solution:** Make sure your CSV file is:
- Named exactly `fraud.csv` (lowercase)
- In the same folder as the script
- Not open in Excel or another program

### Problem: Low Model Performance (ROC-AUC < 0.80)

**Possible causes:**
- Not enough fraud examples (need at least 100)
- Data quality issues (missing values, errors)
- Fraud patterns are random (not predictable)

**Solutions:**
- Collect more historical fraud data
- Check data quality and clean errors
- Add more features (time of day, location, etc.)

### Problem: Too Many False Positives

**Solution:** Adjust the decision threshold:
\`\`\`python
# Instead of 0.5, use 0.7 for fewer false alarms
if fraud_probability > 0.7:  # More conservative
    flag_as_fraud()
\`\`\`
